# Hitomezashi Patterns
This python script is based on the \#mathartchallenge from Twitter user [@anniek_p](https://twitter.com/anniek_p). It is riff on hitomezashi patterns found in Japanese sashiko stitching. More for information on \#mathartchallenge check out [abitrarilyclose](https://arbitrarilyclose.com/home/).

- hitomezashi.py assigns 0s and 1s randomly for a set height and width. hito_input.py allows users to inout text that is translated to binary and is then stitched accordingly. 
- hitomezashi.gif is a collection of outputs generated by hitomezashi.py ran in an IDE ![hitomezasi.gif](https://github.com/rhelmstedter/hitomezashi/blob/main/hitomezashi.gif?raw=true:)
