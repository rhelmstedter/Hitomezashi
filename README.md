# Hitomezashi Patterns
This python script is based on the \#mathartchallenge from Twitter user @anniek_p. It is riff on hitomezashi patterns found in Japanese sashiko stitching. More for infor on \#mathartchallenge check out [abitrarilyclose](https://arbitrarilyclose.com/home/).

Currently, there are two scripts. hitomezashi.py assigns 0s and 1s randomly for a set height and width. hito_input.py allows users to inout text that is translated to binary and then stitched accordingly.
